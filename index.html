        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p>'Enough' is story of a small creature named Mani trying to find her way in the world. Mani wakes up in an unknown location, and explores the world around her, page by page. As Mani discovers new lands she begins to wonder why she is alive, trying to find her truth. Each new page contains novel sites and sounds, as well as a unique instrument that the user can play.</p>

        <p>As Mani learns more about the land she lives in, she goes through a learning process of trying to understand her purpose. Over the course of the 10 pages, Mani finds and loses friends, swims through a sequencer forest, enters a golden sphere, and discovers many other audio-visual delights. Each page has a song that is crafted for the specific visuals and words of that environment.</p>

        <h3>About the Author</h3>

        <p>Using the moniker ‘Cabbibo’, an homage to the late physicist Nicola Cabibbo, Isaac Cohen has published an eclectic array of works ranging from audiovisual fact-learning apps, interactive experiences made from recursive algorithms, to a real-time procedural music blogs where users traverse a universe of sound. His work has been featured in various exhibitions and written about in such blogs as Intel’s Creator’s Project, Google Experiments, The Wild Magazine, Mashable, The Future of Storytelling and Vice’s Thump.  In addition to creating a plethora of experiences, Cohen is also responsible for a number of open source tools to help others create stunning real-time graphics.</p>

        <p>Every project he has published is open source, free, and runs in browser.</p>

        <p>His works can be found at http://cabbi.bo</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>

        <p>Growing up without a television, Isaac Cohen often resorted to immersing himself in the magical world of picture books. He has commonly expressed love for these books and admits that they were one of the most formative parts of his education, both intellectually and emotionally. Because of this, it is no surprise that he chose to make his first opus an echo of his earliest artistic inspirations.</p>

        <p>The story itself is broken into individually hand-crafted pages, each which contains a different graphics technique that Cohen himself has created and developed. Be it the floating forest, which he created after spending time swimming amongst the kelp beds along the California coast, or the glittering creatures inspired by the works of Ernst Haeckel, Cohen is constantly driven by a deep desire to understand nature at fundamental level and simulate it from scratch using the infinite power of computing.</p>

        <h3>Technology</h3>

        <p>As a website, ‘Enough’ uses the powerful technologies present in modern browsers to create its experience. Each page is a separate exploration in a different graphics technique, including procedural geometry creation, GPGPU particle simulations, GPGPU physics simulations, procedural mesh skinning, and audio reactive environments. These explorations are made possible by WebGL and the Web Audio API. By analysing the waveform of the audio, and converting its frequency data to a texture that can be read by WebGL shaders, the music can drive everything from the pulsing of Mani’s tail, to the bands of light on the crystals' surfaces.</p>

        <p>In the case of ‘Enough’, WebGL is accessed by using the Three.js library written by Ricardo Cabello. Completely open source, Three.js has been used to make interactive 3D websites for everything from ‘The Hobbit’ to G-Star.</p>

        <p>Additional libraries include Wagner.js by Jaume Sanchez for optional postprocessing and Leap.js for Motion Control.</p>
